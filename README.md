# UERLTools

**Goal:**
UERLTools aims to provide a seamless Unreal Engine plugin that integrates the powerful [rl_tools](https://github.com/rl-tools) C++ reinforcement learning library with Unreal Engine. The project enables native, high-performance RL workflows in Unreal, exposing agent training and inference to both C++ and Blueprints for real-time game AI, simulation, and research.

- Integrates rl_tools as a third-party dependency for efficient RL algorithms.
- Bridges Unreal's environment components with rl_tools via adapters and data conversion utilities.
- Exposes RL agent management, training, and inference to Blueprints for rapid prototyping and gameplay integration.

**Setup:**
- Clone the rl_tools repository and place it in `Source/ThirdParty/rl_tools`.

**Status:**
Work in progress and not ready for production use.
